# HTTPTests

> Automated HTTP integration testing for GitHub Actions with Docker isolation

Test your APIs, proxies, and microservices in CI/CD with zero configuration. HTTPTests automatically discovers test suites, spins up Docker environments, and validates your HTTP services.

## Features

- **Zero Configuration** - Drop a `.httptests` folder in your repo and go
- **Auto-Discovery** - Automatically finds and runs all test suites in your repository
- **Docker Isolated** - Each test suite runs in its own isolated Docker environment
- **Multi-Service** - Test complex setups with proxies, APIs, and mock services
- **CI Ready** - Built specifically for GitHub Actions workflows
- **Detailed Output** - Clear test results with assertion counts and validation details

## Quick Start

### 1. Add a test suite to your repository

Create a `.httptests` directory with two files:

**`.httptests/config.yml`**
```yaml
mock:
  network_aliases:
    - backend

nginx:
  environment:
    ENV_VAR: value
```

**`.httptests/test.json`**
```json
{
  "hosts": {
    "api.example.com": [
      {
        "paths": ["/health"],
        "method": "GET",
        "expectedStatus": 200,
        "expectedResponseHeaders": [
          ["Content-Type", "application/json"]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Add a Dockerfile for your service

Place a `Dockerfile` in the same directory as `.httptests`:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### 3. Add GitHub Action workflow

**`.github/workflows/test.yml`**
```yaml
name: HTTPTests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: serviceguards-com/httptests-action@v1
```

That's it! Your HTTP integration tests will now run on every push and pull request.

## Use Cases

### API Testing
Test REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and webhooks with comprehensive assertions on status codes, headers, and response bodies.

### Nginx/Proxy Validation
Validate reverse proxy configurations, header transformations, routing rules, and upstream forwarding behavior.

### Microservices Testing
Test service-to-service communication, load balancing, service discovery, and API gateway configurations.

### Load Balancer Testing
Verify load balancer behavior, health checks, failover scenarios, and request distribution.

## Real-World Example

```
=== Processing suite: ./api-service/.httptests ===
📦 Starting Docker services...
🧪 Running tests for httptests-api-service

🔍 Waiting for service to be ready (max 60s)...
  Attempt 1: Service not ready yet (2.0s elapsed)...
  Attempt 2: Service not ready yet (4.1s elapsed)...
✓ Service is ready! (took 5.2s)

test_endpoints (__main__.IntegrationTests.test_endpoints) ... ok
  → Testing: GET api.example.com/health
    ✓ Status code: 200 (expected 200)
    ✓ Response header: content-type = application/json
  → Testing: GET api.example.com/users
    ✓ Status code: 200 (expected 200)
    ✓ Request header forwarded: x-forwarded-for
    ✓ Request header: x-api-version = v1

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Test Suites
HTTPTests automatically discovers and runs all `.httptests` directories:

```
repo/
├── service-a/.httptests/
├── service-b/.httptests/
└── service-c/.httptests/
```

Each suite runs in isolation with its own Docker environment.

### Collection Headers
Define headers once, use them in all tests:

```json
{
  "collectionHeaders": [
    ["X-Request-Id"],
    ["Authorization"]
  ],
  "hosts": {
    "api.example.com": [...]
  }
}
```

### Request/Response Validation
Test status codes, response headers, and upstream request headers:

```json
{
  "paths": ["/api/users"],
  "expectedStatus": 200,
  "expectedResponseHeaders": [
    ["Content-Type", "application/json"]
  ],
  "expectedRequestHeadersToUpstream": [
    ["X-Forwarded-For"],
    ["X-Real-IP"]
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

### Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `working-directory` | Directory to scan for `.httptests` folders | No | `.` |
