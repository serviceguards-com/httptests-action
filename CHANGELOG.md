## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- **Service Health Check**: Automatic health check with configurable timeout before running tests
  - Polls service endpoint until ready (default 60s timeout)
  - Shows progress with attempt counters and elapsed time
  - Provides troubleshooting steps if service fails to start
  - New CLI arguments: `--wait-timeout` and `--skip-health-check`

### Improved
- **Error Logging**: Significantly enhanced error messages throughout
  - Connection errors now show target URL, host header, and possible causes
  - Timeout errors clearly indicate slow response times
  - Status code mismatches show expected vs actual values
  - Missing headers show available headers for easier debugging
  - Header value mismatches show expected vs actual values
  - JSON parsing errors display response content for investigation
- **Docker Error Handling**: Better visibility into container failures
  - Automatic container log dumps when tests fail
  - Shows both nginx and mock container logs
  - Displays container status on startup failures
  - Clear error messages for docker-compose generation failures
- **Progress Indicators**: Added visual feedback with emojis
  - ðŸ“¦ Starting Docker services...
  - ðŸ§ª Running tests...
  - ðŸ§¹ Cleaning up...
  - âœ“/âœ— for success/failure states

### Fixed
- **Connection Refused Error**: Tests now wait for services to be ready before running
  - Eliminates race condition where tests started before containers were ready
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff ensures reliable startup
  - Timeout prevents infinite waiting

### Changed
